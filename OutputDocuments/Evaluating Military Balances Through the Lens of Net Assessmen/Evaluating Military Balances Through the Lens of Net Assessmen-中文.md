Journal of  Military and  Strategic  Studies  Evaluating Military Balances Through the Lens of Net Assessment:  History and Application1  Thomas M. Skypek
淨評估

Introduction For senior statesmen and their advisers, the task of evaluating external security threats and identifying strategic opportunities is a perennial challenge.
引言 對於高級國家領導人及其顧問來說，評估外部安全威脅和識別戰略機會的任務是一項持久的挑戰。

This process is an exercise familiar to all states and is the antecedent of effective national strategy and policy.
這一過程是所有國家都熟悉的練習，是有效國家戰略和政策的前提。

It requires significant intellectual effort, curiosity, creativity, and a tolerance for uncertainty in the exploration of alternative futures.
這需要大量的智力努力、好奇心、創造力，以及在探索替代未來時對不確定性的容忍。

But this task has vexed statesmen throughout history, who have frequently misperceived the threats and behavior of their competitors.
但這項任務在歷史上一直困擾著國家領導人，他們經常誤解競爭對手的威脅和行為。

This article examines one contemporary approach the United States has employed to understand the complex state-based military and security threats confronting it: net assessment.
淨評估

Four major tasks are attempted in this article: first, to provide a clear definition of net assessment, as practiced by the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment (OSD/NA);

The body of scholarly literature examining net assessment is limited.
淨評估

Primary sources comprise the majority of work on this subject and many of these sources remain classified.
主要來源佔據了這一主題的大部分工作，且許多這些來源仍然是機密的。

As a result, net assessment is one of the more esoteric tools available to analysts and policymakers.
淨評估

Many who have heard of net assessment often mistake it as simply a threat assessment or a strategic, ‚big picture‛ evaluation.
淨評估

To do so, however, misses a great deal.
然而，這樣做卻錯過了很多重要的內容。

Additionally, there are no textbooks on net assessment, just a few articles from former practitioners and the courses they teach at a handful of American universities.
淨評估

Therefore, the acquisition of this knowledge is generated more from apprenticeship rather than academic study.
因此，這種知識的獲取更多來自於學徒制而非學術研究。

Drawing on a number of declassified and other primary source documents, this article fills a gap in the existing literature by telling an important, but largely untold, cold war narrative.
本文章利用多份解密及其他主要來源文件，填補了現有文獻中的一個空白，講述了一個重要但大多未被講述的冷戰故事。

Field interviews were also conducted with former Department of Defense officials, including current and former staff members of the Office of Net Assessment.
淨評估

Net assessment, like the field of strategic studies itself, is a product of the cold war struggle for power that defined the latter half of the twentieth century.
淨評估

It provided analysts and policymakers in the Pentagon with a framework for conceptualizing the United States-Soviet military competition.
它為五角大樓的分析師和政策制定者提供了一個框架，以概念化美國與蘇聯的軍事競爭。

It remains applicable today for the United States in the post-cold war world as the relative military power of states such as China and India increases.
在冷戰後的世界中，隨著中國和印度等國家的相對軍事力量增強，這一框架對美國仍然適用。

Defining Net Assessment The scholarly literature offers few definitions of net assessment.
淨評估

Eliot Cohen, who served as a military assistant to the Director of Net Assessment in the 1980s, defined net assessment simply as ‚the appraisal of military balances.‛
淨評估

Stephen Rosen, who worked as a civilian assistant in the Office of Net Assessment, offered an equally concise definition identifying net assessment as ‚the analysis of the interaction of national security establishments in peacetime and war.‛
淨評估

Each of these definitions captures the fundamental characteristics of
這些定義都捕捉到了淨評估的基本特徵。

While this article focuses on the utility of net assessment for analyzing state interactions, Yee-Kuang Heng examines how net assessment could be modified to analyze the Global War on Terror and the Iraqi insurgency: See Yee-Kuang Heng, ‚Old Wine in New Bottles?

net assessment.
淨評估

However, a more robust definition, and a full exploration of its analytical elements and characteristics, are warranted.
然而，更為穩健的定義以及對其分析要素和特徵的全面探索是必要的。

Building on the work of Cohen and Rosen, the following definition is offered:
基於科恩和羅森的工作，提出以下定義：

Net assessment is a multidisciplinary approach to national security analysis that is comparative, diagnostic, and forward-looking.
淨評估

More precisely, net assessment is a framework for evaluating the long-term strategic political-military competitions in which states engage.
淨評估

As the word ‘competition’ implies, net assessors view the interactions of states as inherently competitive rather than inherently cooperative.
正如“競爭”一詞所暗示的，淨評估者將國家之間的互動視為本質上具有競爭性，而非本質上合作性。

The aim of net assessment is to diagnose strategic asymmetries between competitors and to identify environmental opportunities in order to support senior policymakers in the making of strategy.
淨評估

Net assessment relies heavily on the analysis of long-term trends in order to explore plausible alternative security futures.
淨評估

As a multidisciplinary framework, it incorporates elements of economics, military history, political science, and organizational behavior and employs a variety of quantitative and qualitative methodologies.
作為一個多學科框架，它融合了經濟學、軍事歷史、政治科學和組織行為的要素，並採用各種定量和定性的方法。

Two characteristics differentiate net assessment from other modes of defense analysis:
淨評估

(1) it analyzes both Blue and Red capabilities together in order to identify strategic asymmetries and areas of comparative advantage,
(1) 它同時分析藍方和紅方的能力，以識別戰略不對稱和比較優勢領域，

(2) it focuses on diagnosis rather than policy prescription.
(2) 它專注於診斷而非政策處方。

The desired analytical output of a net assessment is a complete picture of a competitive political-military relationship including the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and fears of each competitor (state).
淨評估

This is dependent on an even-handed, objective analysis of each competitor—including a dispassionate self-assessment of one’s capabilities and weaknesses.
這依賴於對每個競爭者的公正、客觀的分析，包括對自身能力和弱點的冷靜自我評估。

Net assessments generally fall into one of two categories: geographical or functional.
淨評估

Geographical net assessments examine the military balance of a particular region, such as the
淨評估

In the context of net assessment, ‘asymmetries’ are areas of comparative advantage within a military balance.
淨評估

Insights from other disciplines—including psychology, cultural anthropology, demography, strategic culture, and the life sciences—have been leveraged as well in order to conduct assessments.
來自其他學科的見解，包括心理學、文化人類學、人口學、戰略文化和生命科學，也被用來進行評估。

The terms ‘Red’ and ‘Blue’ are used in the United States defense community, especially in the context of wargaming.
在美國防務界，‘紅方’和‘藍方’這兩個術語被使用，特別是在戰爭遊戲的背景下。

Traditionally, ‘Red’ represents an adversarial state or non-state actor while ‘Blue’ refers to U.S. or allied forces.

第12卷，第2期，2010年冬季 5 | 頁面 國際系統中的軍事力量是相對的，只能相對於其他國家進行評估的概念。

In 1966, Marshall explained:  ‚Estimating the military power of the United States, or any other country, can only be done relative to that of another country, or set of countries viewed as an alliance.‛14
在1966年，馬歇爾解釋道：‘評估美國或任何其他國家的軍事力量只能相對於另一個國家或被視為聯盟的一組國家進行。’

Marshall’s words underscore the centrality of both comparison and relative power—two important elements of the net assessment framework.
淨評估

Marshall also understood that estimating military power depended on more than quantitative force comparisons:  ‚One has only to cite the extremely successful German attack in 1940 on the combined French and British forces to indicate that equality of forces and equipment does not lead to a stalemated outcome.‛15
馬歇爾還明白，評估軍事力量不僅僅依賴於數量上的力量比較：‘只需舉出1940年德國對法國和英國聯合軍隊的極其成功的攻擊，就可以表明力量和裝備的平等並不會導致僵局。’

Marshall was a pioneer in emphasizing the human element of military balances—factoring in important considerations such as organizational and bureaucratic behavior.
馬歇爾是強調軍事平衡中人為因素的先驅——考慮到組織和官僚行為等重要因素。

His example of the Battle of France underscores the importance of non-materiel variables such as military doctrine, training, and leadership when evaluating military balances.
他以法國戰役為例，強調在評估軍事平衡時，非物質變量如軍事學說、訓練和領導力的重要性。

In this case, the role of doctrinal innovation by the German military is instructive.
在這種情況下，德國軍隊的學說創新角色是值得借鑒的。

The Germans, numerically outnumbered, developed new and innovative ways of employing their forces, effectively negating any advantage the French enjoyed in terms of force strength—to include manpower and tanks.
德國軍隊在數量上處於劣勢，卻開發出新的創新方式來運用其部隊，有效地抵消了法國在力量強度方面的任何優勢——包括人力和坦克。

In the case of the Battle of France, German doctrinal innovation proved to be a critical determinant in the evolution and eventual outcome of the campaign.
在法國戰役中，德國的學說創新被證明是該戰役演變和最終結果的關鍵因素。

To take a contemporary example, a net assessment examining the India-Pakistan military balance would not only consider the force structure and posture of each competitor but also each side’s military doctrine, training, leadership and economic capacity to make war.
淨評估

This approach differs drastically from the so-called ‚bean counters‛ who rely more exclusively on quantitative force figures to analyze balances and predict military outcomes.
這種方法與所謂的‘計算者’截然不同，後者更專注於依賴數量上的力量數據來分析平衡和預測軍事結果。

History is replete with examples of numerically inferior military forces defeating numerically superior forces.
歷史上充滿了數量劣勢的軍事力量擊敗數量優勢的軍事力量的例子。

However, while numerical superiority alone does not always guarantee outcomes in military conflict, states with numerically superior forces have tended to win the majority of their wars against states with smaller military forces.
然而，雖然單靠數量優勢並不總能保證軍事衝突的結果，但擁有數量優勢的國家往往在與軍事力量較小的國家的戰爭中獲勝。

Blueprint for the Conduct of Net Assessments Building on the previous section which examined the definition of net assessment and explored some of its fundamental concepts, this section provides a blueprint for the conduct of net assessments by analysts.
淨評估

Determining how to conceptualize a given balance is an important first step and depends largely on the type of assessment being conducted (functional v. geographical) and the nature of the competition being investigated.
確定如何概念化特定的平衡是一個重要的第一步，並且在很大程度上取決於進行的評估類型（功能性與地理性）以及所調查的競爭性質。

For example, an assessment focusing on a maritime competition between two states would analyze the acquisition trends of each state’s naval service as well as their respective naval doctrines.
例如，專注於兩國之間海洋競爭的評估將分析每個國家海軍服務的採購趨勢以及各自的海軍教義。

The ability of each state to maintain, deploy, and employ its operational capabilities in a variety of military contingencies would also be considered.
每個國家在各種軍事突發事件中維持、部署和運用其作戰能力的能力也將被考慮在內。

The analysis would likely focus on the operational and strategic levels of war.
分析可能會集中於戰爭的作戰和戰略層面。

However, the overall balance would be analyzed in the context of each competitor’s national interest, grand strategy, and foreign policy.
然而，整體平衡將在每個競爭者的國家利益、宏觀戰略和外交政策的背景下進行分析。

The integration of this type of high-level political analysis into military assessments provides much needed context for understanding the balance.
將這種高層次的政治分析融入軍事評估中，為理解平衡提供了急需的背景。

Net assessors, therefore, are generally Clausewitzian in their belief that war is an extension of politics by other means and that separating political decision-making from military decision-making is an artificial cleavage that will result in an incomplete analysis.
因此，網絡評估者通常是克勞塞維茨主義者，他們相信戰爭是政治的另一種延伸，並且將政治決策與軍事決策分開是一種人為的劃分，將導致不完整的分析。

Deciding how to structure the assessment requires the analyst to decide on which metrics, variables, and capabilities to consider.
決定如何結構評估需要分析師決定考慮哪些指標、變量和能力。

A military balance can be evaluated using any number of materiel and non-materiel factors.
軍事平衡可以使用多種物質和非物質因素進行評估。

Force structure and posture tend to be the default variables for many analysts but an overreliance on these factors can result in flawed assessments.
力量結構和姿態往往是許多分析師的默認變量，但過度依賴這些因素可能會導致評估出現缺陷。

As noted in a previous section, a balance is much more than the sum total of each side’s forces.
如前一部分所述，平衡遠不止於每一方力量的總和。

This discussion of analytic metrics highlights an important part of the net.

While there are certain distinguishing characteristics and a basic structure that differentiates net assessment from other modes of defense analysis, it is a malleable framework.
淨評估

In other words, the assessor has significant creative license in how the assessment is conducted in terms of the questions asked and the methodologies employed.
換句話說，評估者在進行評估時，在提出問題和採用方法論方面擁有相當大的創造性自由。

There are four pillars of a net assessment:  trends, doctrine, asymmetries and scenarios.
淨評估

Trend analysis is the first pillar of net assessment.
淨評估

Long-term trends in the acquisition of specific weapons systems and platforms are especially instructive for net assessors.
特定武器系統和平台的長期趨勢對淨評估者特別有啟發性。

National-level trends such as defense spending constitute equally valuable data points.
國家層面的趨勢，如國防開支，也構成同樣有價值的數據點。

For example, gradual increases in a state’s defense spending over a number of years might look insignificant if observed only incrementally but when the aggregate increase is assessed the implications can be substantial.
例如，若僅逐年觀察，一個國家的國防開支逐漸增加可能看起來微不足道，但當評估總體增長時，其影響可能是重大的。

The emphasis on long-term trends is important because it provides policymakers with an understanding of potential future ‚shocks‛ to the balance—developments which could fundamentally alter the military balance.
強調長期趨勢是重要的，因為它使政策制定者了解可能對平衡造成的未來‘衝擊’——這些發展可能根本改變軍事平衡。

For instance, let us say that country Green acquires several new combat aircraft over the course of a decade but due to budget constraints is forced to forgo the acquisition of precision munitions for the aircraft.
例如，假設綠國在十年間獲得幾架新戰鬥機，但因預算限制被迫放棄為這些飛機購買精確彈藥。

After a period of rapid economic growth, Green procures advanced precision munitions for its combat aircraft.
在一段快速經濟增長後，綠國為其戰鬥機採購了先進的精確彈藥。

Such a scenario could significantly impact Green’s position vis-à-vis neighboring country Orange, which does not possess an operational precision strike capability.
這樣的情境可能會顯著影響綠國相對於鄰國橙國的地位，後者並不具備作戰的精確打擊能力。

The extrapolation of long-term trends supports the development of plausible alternative futures, or scenarios, which are used to conduct assessments.
長期趨勢的外推支持可行的替代未來或情境的發展，這些情境用於進行評估。

Scenarios are discussed in more detail later in this section.
本節稍後將更詳細地討論情境。

Doctrine is the second pillar of net assessment.
淨評估

As the 1940 Battle of France illustrated, there is more to understanding military balances than the numbers of divisions, tanks, fighters, or submarines a military organization possesses; how it elects to employ its forces matters, too.
正如1940年法國戰役所示，理解軍事平衡不僅僅是軍事組織擁有的師、坦克、戰鬥機或潛艇的數量；它如何選擇使用其部隊也很重要。

Net assessment takes into account the fact that all militaries do not fight wars in the same way and recognizes that even individual military services within a single military organization can vary dramatically in the manner in which they conduct military operations.

Additionally, as Barry Posen noted, doctrine is an important ‚subcomponent of grand strategy that deals

Thus, an analysis of a state’s military doctrine can provide insights into the fundamental goals of the state, its perceived threats, and the interests it may be willing to go to war in order to defend—not to mention how it intends to employ its forces in the event of armed conflict.
因此，對一個國家軍事學說的分析可以提供該國基本目標、其感知威脅以及可能願意為之而戰的利益的見解——更不用說它在武裝衝突發生時打算如何運用其部隊。

Revisiting the example of country Green in the paragraph above, a net assessor would analyze Green’s air power doctrine looking for shifts from a defensive posture to an offensive posture, or other doctrinal modifications, that could impact the balance.
重新回顧上段中綠國的例子，網絡評估者將分析綠國的空中力量學說，尋找從防禦姿態轉向攻擊姿態的變化，或其他可能影響平衡的學說修改。

The identification of strategic asymmetries is the third pillar of net assessment.
淨評估

When comparing the military capabilities of two competitors, asymmetries or areas of comparative advantage are likely to emerge.
在比較兩個競爭者的軍事能力時，不對稱或比較優勢的領域可能會出現。

Continuing with the previous example, Green’s acquisition of new combat aircraft and precision munitions have given it a significant advantage in air power over its neighbor, Orange.
繼續之前的例子，綠國獲得新型戰鬥機和精確彈藥，使其在空中力量上相對於鄰國橙國擁有顯著優勢。

However, while Orange may have a disadvantage in the air domain, its land and naval power is superior to that of Green.
然而，雖然橙國在空中領域可能處於劣勢，但其陸軍和海軍力量卻優於綠國。

Net Evaluation in the Eisenhower Administration
艾森豪威爾政府的淨評估

This section details the history of net assessment within the United States government.
淨評估

The origins of net assessment within the United States government can be traced to the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower who established a small group within the NSC to provide annual scenario-based evaluations of United States and Soviet nuclear capabilities.
淨評估

The evaluations were forward-looking, typically looking up to two years in the future.
這些評估具有前瞻性，通常展望未來兩年。

The group, first called the Special Evaluation Subcommittee, was established in January 1953 with an interagency membership that included the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference and the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security.
該小組最初稱為特別評估小組，於1953年1月成立，成員來自多個機構，包括參謀長聯席會議、中央情報局、跨部門情報會議和跨部門內部安全委員會。

The group went through a series of name changes—known as the Net Capabilities Evaluation Subcommittee in 1954 and finally the Net Evaluation Subcommittee (NESC) in 1955 when the group was made permanent.
該小組經歷了一系列名稱變更——在1954年被稱為淨能力評估小組，並在1955年成為正式機構時最終改名為淨評估小組（NESC）。

The NESC was chaired by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
NESC由參謀長聯席會議主席主持。

Its assessments focused solely on the United States-Soviet strategic nuclear balance and hypothesized what a nuclear exchange between the two states might actually look like.
其評估僅專注於美國與蘇聯的戰略核平衡，並假設兩國之間的核交換實際上可能會是什麼樣子。

NESC explored concepts central to United States nuclear planning from strategic early warning and nuclear targeting to force requirements and the proliferation of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
NESC探討了美國核規劃的核心概念，從戰略早期預警和核目標設定到部隊需求和洲際彈道導彈的擴散。

NESC analyses provided Eisenhower with a senior-level perspective of the strategic competition the United States found itself in.
NESC的分析為艾森豪威爾提供了美國所面臨的戰略競爭的高層視角。

NESC survived the 1960 presidential election but was eventually eliminated during the Johnson administration at the behest of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara who believed NESC’s studies duplicated efforts of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
NESC在1960年總統選舉中存活下來，但最終在約翰遜政府期間被消除，這是應國防部長羅伯特·麥克納馬拉的要求，他認為NESC的研究重複了參謀長聯席會議和國防部辦公室的工作。

McNamara believed that the final NESC report, issued in 1964, was an inadequate ‚basis for planning guidance.‛36
麥克納馬拉認為，1964年發佈的最終NESC報告是一個不充分的「規劃指導基礎。」36

Ironically, the NESC was eliminated at a time when it was arguably most needed.

In order to define net assessment, Marshall leveraged concepts he had explored during his time at RAND—namely those of comparison and relative power:
淨評估

Our notion of a net assessment is that it is a careful comparison of U.S. weapon systems, forces, and policies in relation to those of other countries.

While Marshall believed net assessment would provide senior policymakers with a more complete understanding of the major strategic challenges facing the United States, he believed that net assessment should augment rather than replace other existing methods of analysis being undertaken in the intelligence community.
淨評估

By April 1973, Marshall believed that the ‚basic assumptions of U.S. foreign and defense policy‛ were evolving and he envisioned that net assessment would test existing assumptions.

Marshall had already leveraged scenario-based planning methodologies such as wargaming during his tenure at the RAND Corporation during the 1950s and 1960s.
馬歇爾在1950年代和1960年代於RAND公司任職期間，已經利用了基於情境的規劃方法論，如戰爭遊戲。

He believed that analyses based solely on systems analysis—used extensively by the Pentagon during Robert McNamara’s tenure—were incomplete; systems analysis oversimplified complex problems into purely quantitative terms.
他認為僅基於系統分析的分析（在羅伯特·麥克納馬任內被五角大樓廣泛使用）是不完整的；系統分析將複雜問題過度簡化為純粹的定量術語。

The multidisciplinary nature of net assessment is one of its defining characteristics and has been since its formal establishment within the U.S. government as a framework for national security analysis.

然而，馬歇爾的提議並未被普遍接受為前進的道路。

Admiral T.H. Moorer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, raised concerns over Marshall’s proposal.
聯合參謀長聯席會議主席T.H.穆爾爾海軍上將對馬歇爾的提議表示擔憂。

He insisted that the concept of net assessment remained ill-defined and that assessments of a military nature should not be conducted by civilians.

Moorer argued that military matters and related assessments should conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
穆爾爾主張軍事事務及相關評估應由聯合參謀長聯席會議進行。

He was particularly concerned with the idea that a civilian organization would be producing assessments on military matters.
他特別擔心平民組織會對軍事事務進行評估的想法。

While Moorer’s non-concurrence did not halt the development of the net assessment program, his objections highlight an important tension that often exists between civilian and military personnel in the Pentagon.

The Deputy Secretary of Defense, William ‚A.P.‛ Clements, largely supported Marshall’s findings but wanted the net assessment mission to be defined more clearly so as to not duplicate existing analytical efforts.

Like Marshall, Clements believed that net assessment should be diagnostic rather than prescriptive.

Marshall was enthusiastic about the level of interest the incoming secretary of defense, Marshall’s close friend and former RAND colleague Jim Schlesinger, had shown in the nascent net assessment program:

See Cohen, ‚Net Assessment: An American Approach,‛ p. 22: Cohen has argued that net assessment offices should be civilian-led for three reasons: 1) military officers rotate every two to three years and the nature of net assessment requires a more permanent leadership, 2) it is easier for civilians to maintain a ‚policymaking perspective,‛ and 3) military personnel tend to think of themselves as ‚apolitical technical experts‛ unwilling to ask difficult political questions.

Over the past four decades, the Office of Net Assessment and its work has, at times, subtly influenced the way senior Department of Defense officials considered defense and military matters.

Through its sponsorship of important research and its ability to convey its findings directly to the secretary and deputy secretary of defense,63 the Pentagon’s internal think tank has served an important function within the Department of Defense.
通過對重要研究的贊助以及直接向國防部長和副部長傳達其發現的能力，五角大樓的內部智庫在國防部內部發揮了重要作用。

Since its establishment, the office has made significant intellectual contributions in several national security areas including: the U.S.-Soviet strategic nuclear balance; the NATO-Warsaw Pact conventional military balance; the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA); and more recently the emerging U.S.-China military competition.
自成立以來，該辦公室在幾個國家安全領域做出了重要的智力貢獻，包括：美國-蘇聯的戰略核平衡；北約-華沙條約的常規軍事平衡；軍事事務革命（RMA）；以及最近出現的美中軍事競爭。

Periodically, elements of OSD/NA’s work influenced important national policy changes, including Presidential Directive-59, which introduced the ‘countervailing’ strategy that aimed to provide the president with more limited strike options in the event of a nuclear conflict.
定期，OSD/NA的工作要素影響了重要的國家政策變化，包括總統指令-59，該指令引入了旨在為總統在核衝突發生時提供更有限打擊選擇的‘對抗’策略。

In an effort to enhance the credibility of U.S. deterrence posture, PD-59 also called for the explicit targeting of Soviet political and military leadership.
為了增強美國威懾姿態的可信度，PD-59還要求明確針對蘇聯的政治和軍事領導層。

While PD-59 was billed by the Carter administration as a ‘refinement’ of existing U.S. nuclear policy, approval of PD-59 represented an important modification in U.S. nuclear policy consistent with Marshall’s belief in the deficiencies of the U.S.’s existing assured destruction doctrine.
雖然卡特政府將PD-59視為對現有美國核政策的‘精煉’，但PD-59的批准代表了美國核政策的重要修改，與馬歇爾對美國現有的確保毀滅教義缺陷的信念一致。

By August 1976, Marshall believed that the Soviet Union was developing systems and capabilities that would ‘erode our *U.S.+ assured destruction capabilities.’
到1976年8月，馬歇爾認為蘇聯正在發展將‘侵蝕我們的*美國+確保毀滅能力’的系統和能力。

Marshall explained that as the circular error probable of Soviet missiles dropped, the risk to the U.S. silo-based Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) fleet would increase.
馬歇爾解釋說，隨著蘇聯導彈的圓形誤差概率下降，美國基於筒倉的洲際彈道導彈（ICBM）艦隊的風險將增加。

As U.S. ICBMs became increasingly vulnerable, the ability of the U.S. to credibly threaten the Soviet economy would drop along with the ability to deter.
隨著美國ICBM變得越來越脆弱，美國對蘇聯經濟的可信威脅能力將隨之下降，威懾能力也會下降。

Marshall also indicated that the Soviets were taking steps to ensure that their political and military leadership as well as the centers of their economic and military power would survive a nuclear war—measures inconsistent with the U.S. view of the doctrine of assured destruction.
馬歇爾還指出，蘇聯正在採取措施以確保其政治和軍事領導層以及其經濟和軍事力量的中心能夠在核戰爭中存活——這些措施與美國對確保毀滅教義的看法不一致。

The Soviet programs included the protection of the civilian population as well as Soviet officials.

In order to consider the potential implications of an emerging RMA on the Department, Marshall recommended that the secretary of defense establish a senior-level group to explore the RMA and its implications for the Department of Defense.
為了考慮新興RMA對國防部的潛在影響，馬歇爾建議國防部長成立一個高層小組來探索RMA及其對國防部的影響。

1994年，成立了RMA指導小組，由國防部副部長約翰·德奇主持，並包括國防部長威廉·佩里參加。

In the 1990s, Marshall’s work continued to highlight the human dimensions of RMAs and the importance of doctrinal innovation, concluding in a statement before the Senate Subcommittee on Acquisition and Technology that: ‚Innovations in technology make a military revolution possible, but the revolution itself takes place only when new concepts of operation develop and, in many cases, new military organizations are created.‛
在1990年代，馬歇爾的工作繼續強調RMA的人文維度和教義創新的重要性，並在參議院採購和技術小組委員會的聲明中總結道：『技術創新使軍事革命成為可能，但革命本身只有在新的作戰概念發展出來時才會發生，並且在許多情況下，新的軍事組織會被創建。』

As early as 1977, OSD/NA produced an assessment of the military balance in Northeast Asia identifying the region as an area of emerging strategic importance for the United States.
早在1977年，國防部/網絡評估辦公室就對東北亞的軍事平衡進行了評估，將該地區確定為美國新興戰略重要性區域。

In the mid-1990s, the office sponsored several studies which highlighted major differences in strategic thinking between the Chinese political leadership and officer corps and their American counterparts.
在1990年代中期，該辦公室贊助了幾項研究，突顯了中國政治領導層和軍官團與美國對應者之間的戰略思維重大差異。

The insights from these studies caution American defense analysts to avoid the analytical trap of mirror-imaging—that is superimposing U.S. biases and prejudices when analyzing Chinese behavior.
這些研究的見解提醒美國防務分析師避免鏡像映射的分析陷阱，即在分析中國行為時疊加美國的偏見和成見。

Marshall made the same argument throughout the cold war when assessing Soviet behavior.
馬歇爾在冷戰期間評估蘇聯行為時也提出了相同的論點。

The Office of Net Assessment’s influence has varied greatly since 1973, depending largely on the office’s relationship with the Pentagon leadership it served.

Research suggests that the office enjoyed its greatest influence under Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Harold Brown, and its least influence under Caspar Weinberger and William Cohen.
研究表明，該辦公室在國防部長唐納德·拉姆斯菲爾德和哈羅德·布朗任內享有最大的影響力，而在卡斯帕·溫伯格和威廉·科恩任內則影響力最小。

According to Barry Watts, the office had the most influence in the Carter administration under Harold Brown and the least influence during the Reagan administration under Caspar Weinberger.
根據巴里·瓦茨的說法，該辦公室在卡特政府哈羅德·布朗任內影響力最大，而在里根政府卡斯帕·溫伯格任內影響力最小。

In fact, William Taft, who served as deputy secretary of defense from 1984 – 1989 in the Reagan administration, had relatively limited interactions with Marshall and the office during his tenure in the Pentagon; the same was true for his boss, Caspar Weinberger.
事實上，威廉·塔夫特在里根政府擔任國防部副部長（1984年至1989年）期間，與馬歇爾和該辦公室的互動相對有限；他的上司卡斯帕·溫伯格也是如此。

In May 2000, Marshall reflected on OSD/NA’s contributions to the Department of Defense during the cold war:
在2000年5月，馬歇爾回顧了OSD/NA在冷戰期間對國防部的貢獻：

One of our biggest contributions was in providing a better way of thinking about the military balance in particular areas providing an analysis of the long term trends and asymmetries that impacted the military balance, as well as an intelligent choice in how to measure ourselves against the Soviet Union.
我們最大的貢獻之一是提供了一種更好的思考特定區域軍事平衡的方式，分析影響軍事平衡的長期趨勢和不對稱性，以及如何明智地衡量自己與蘇聯的關係。

OSD/NA’s influence has fluctuated over the years as its relationship with the various secretaries, military services and others within the Office of the Secretary of Defense has changed.
隨著其與各位秘書、軍事部門及國防部辦公室內其他人的關係變化，OSD/NA的影響力多年来一直在波動。

The Utility of Net Assessment for Analysts and Policymakers

This section examines the analytical utility of net assessment for defense analysts and, more importantly, for senior statesmen and their advisers.

The argument focuses on two points: (1) how net assessment can redress organizational impediments to sound national security analysis typically found in large bureaucracies, and (2) how net assessment can both inform and enhance the development of national strategy.

Further, the proliferation of twenty-four hour news networks, blogs, and an increase in internet news readership have compressed the news cycle.
此外，二十四小時新聞網絡、博客的激增以及互聯網新聞讀者的增加壓縮了新聞周期。

This new reality compels senior policymakers to operate largely within this accelerated news cycle dealing often with short-term emergent crises.
這一新現實迫使高層決策者主要在這個加速的新聞周期內運作，經常處理短期的突發危機。

There is a tendency to focus on day-to-day operations, the so-called ‚crisis of the hour‛ and, of course, budgetary matters.
有一種傾向是專注於日常運作，所謂的「當前危機」，當然還有預算問題。

Michael E. Milakovich argues that governments in particular are driven by ‚annual budget cycles‛ and that long-term thinking is often, at best, an ancillary concern.
邁克爾·E·米拉科維奇認為，政府特別受到「年度預算周期」的驅動，長期思考通常充其量只是附帶的關注。

Another explanation for this phenomenon, according to Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow, is that organizations are typically reluctant to ‚base actions on estimates of an uncertain future.‛
根據格雷厄姆·艾利森和菲利普·澤利科的說法，這一現象的另一個解釋是，組織通常不願意「根據對不確定未來的估計來制定行動」。

Paul Bracken notes that Washington’s national security agenda is usually driven by one of two ‚rhythms‛:  the current news cycle or a change in presidential administrations.

Neither of these ‚rhythms,‛ he argues, is particularly long-term in orientation.

Thus, net assessment should be viewed as a vehicle for facilitating the type of long-term, strategic thinking that typically gets neglected in large bureaucracies.

The challenge of sharing and integrating national security information across various departments, agencies, and offices is another organizational barrier which frequently hinders analytical efforts.
在各個部門、機構和辦公室之間共享和整合國家安全信息的挑戰是另一個經常妨礙分析工作的組織障礙。

According to Douglas J. Feith, who served as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy from 2001 – 2005, ‚National security policy requires a lot of thinking and there are a number of major flaws derived from institutional problems that hurt the quality of thinking in the government about national security.‛
根據道格拉斯·J·費斯的說法，他在2001年至2005年擔任國防部政策副部長，「國家安全政策需要大量思考，並且存在多個源於制度問題的主要缺陷，這些缺陷損害了政府對國家安全的思考質量。」

One of these flaws is the way governments divide their responsibilities.
這些缺陷之一是政府劃分其職責的方式。

Take, for example, the United States national security bureaucracy.
以美國的國家安全官僚機構為例。

The offices and agencies which comprise this bureaucracy—such as the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Intelligence Community—are typically organized regionally or functionally.
組成這一官僚機構的辦公室和機構——如國家安全委員會、國防部、國務院和情報界——通常按地區或功能組織。

Most of the Department of Defense’s primary military organs—the combatant commands—are organized regionally or functionally.
國防部的大多數主要軍事機構——作戰指揮部——都是按地區或功能組織的。

As a result, the personnel in these organizations tend to focus solely on their regional or functional responsibilities.
因此，這些組織中的人員往往僅專注於他們的地區或功能責任。

In doing so, they often miss the broader, strategic picture.
這樣一來，他們往往會忽視更廣泛的戰略全局。

Efforts to enhance interagency coordination among the U.S. departments, agencies, and offices with national security missions has improved dramatically in recent years.
在美國各部門、機構和辦公室之間加強國家安全任務的跨機構協調的努力在近年來有了顯著改善。

這對政治家尤其重要，因為它使他們能夠識別新興威脅以及戰略環境中的新機會。

The net assessment process is akin to medical diagnostics.
淨評估

Statesmen, like physicians, must diagnose both current and emerging threats to their interests.
政治家就像醫生一樣，必須診斷對其利益的當前和新興威脅。

Niccolo Machiavelli, the Italian political philosopher, employed this analogy nearly five centuries ago: ‚<by recognizing evils in advance (a gift granted only to the prudent ruler), they can be cured quickly; but when they are not recognized and are left to grow to such an extent that everyone recognizes them, there is no longer any remedy.
意大利政治哲學家尼科洛·馬基雅維利在近五個世紀前使用了這個比喻：「通過提前識別邪惡（這是只有明智的統治者才能獲得的天賦），它們可以迅速治愈；但當它們未被識別並且放任其發展到每個人都認識到的程度時，就再也沒有任何補救措施。」

A physician who diagnoses a disease at its onset generally has more treatment options at his or her disposal.
一位在疾病初期診斷出病症的醫生通常擁有更多的治療選擇。

Similarly, statesmen who diagnose national problems before they mature have a greater chance of effectively managing emerging threats and securing favorable outcomes than those who fail to think beyond the present.
同樣，提前診斷國家問題的政治家比那些未能超越當前思考的人更有可能有效管理新興威脅並獲得有利結果。

Yet, perhaps net assessment’s greatest gift to strategists is the Clausewitzian reminder that war is ‚a continuation of policy by other means‛ and that failing to consider military affairs in a broader political context can have catastrophic consequences for the state.
淨評估

In other words, the integration of high-level political analysis into military assessments provides statesmen with the necessary context for thinking about the strategic competition in which they are engaged.
換句話說，將高層政治分析融入軍事評估為政治家提供了必要的背景，以思考他們所參與的戰略競爭。
